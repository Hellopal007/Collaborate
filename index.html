    <h2>try contributing for first time</h2>
    <p>Contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn new skills and gain experience. It also allows you to give back to the community and help improve the software that you use. If you are new to open source, here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a project that interests you: Look for projects that you are passionate about and that you would like to contribute to. This will make the process more enjoyable and rewarding.</li>
      <li>Read the contribution guidelines: Before you start contributing, make sure to read the project's contribution guidelines. This will help you understand how to contribute effectively and follow the project's coding standards.</li>
      <li>Start small: If you are new to open source, it's a good idea to start with small contributions. This will help you get familiar with the project and the community, and build your confidence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My First Branch</h2>
    <p>Branch is a part of the code that is isolated from the main code. It is used to develop new features without affecting the main code. Once the feature is developed, it can be merged with the main code.</p>
    <p>Branching is a very useful feature of version control systems like Git. It allows developers to work on different features in isolation. It also allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work.</p>

    <h2>A <strong>fork</strong> and a <strong>clone</strong> are related but serve different purposes in Git:</h2>
    <h3>Fork</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A fork is a copy of a repository that is created on a remote platform like GitHub under your account.</li>
      <li>It is typically used when you want to contribute to someone else's project. You fork their repository to your GitHub account, make changes, and then submit a pull request to propose your changes.</li>
      <li>A fork is independent of the original repository, but you can sync it with the upstream repository to pull in updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Clone</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A clone is a local copy of a repository (either your own or someone else's) on your machine.</li>
      <li>It is created using the git clone command and allows you to work on the repository locally.</li>
      <li>A clone is directly tied to the remote repository it was cloned from (e.g., for pushing and pulling changes).</li>
    </ul>
