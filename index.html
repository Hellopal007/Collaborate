    <h1>My First Branch</h1>
    <p>Branch is a part of the code that is isolated from the main code. It is used to develop new features without affecting the main code. Once the feature is developed, it can be merged with the main code.</p>
    <p>Branching is a very useful feature of version control systems like Git. It allows developers to work on different features in isolation. It also allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work.</p>
